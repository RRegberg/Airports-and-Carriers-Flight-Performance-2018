Establishing data frame with reduced set of initial variables and creation of additional variables for regression models below.

# Regression Model

Plotting mean departure delay versus total operations by airport and grouping by state. 
```{r}
flights_temp %>%
  filter(Origin_State != "RI" & Origin_State != "VT") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Tot_Ops.x, y = Mean_Dep_Delay, group = Origin_State, color = Origin_State)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  xlab("Total Airport Operations") +
  ylab("Mean Departure Delay") +
  labs(title = "Delay trend by operations") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Linear regression model output for mean departure delay on total operations by state: 
```{r}
flights_nested <- flights_temp %>%
  filter(Origin_State != "RI" & Origin_State != "VT") %>%
  group_by(Origin_State) %>%
  nest() 

flights_nested <- flights_nested %>%
  mutate(lmout = map(data, ~lm(Mean_Dep_Delay ~ Tot_Ops.x, data = .))) %>%
  mutate(tidyout = map(lmout, ~tidy(., conf.int = TRUE)))

flights_lmtidy <- unnest(flights_nested, tidyout)
flights_lmtidy
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#ignore this bit -- just experimenting
flights_lmtidy %>%
  filter (term == "Tot_Ops.x") %>%
  mutate(region_order = fct_reorder(Region, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = region_order, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(-0.01,0,0.01), linetype = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = region_order, xend = region_order, y = conf.low, yend = conf.high), 
               color = "black", alpha = 0.3) +
  ylab("Rate of  change") +
  xlab("Region") +
  labs(title = "Average estimated departure delay per region with confindence intervals") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```

```{r}
flights_lmtidy %>%
  filter(term == "Tot_Ops.x") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Region, estimate), y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = Region, xend = Region, y = conf.low, yend = conf.high), 
               color = "black", alpha = 0.3) +

```
The estimated mean departure delays are not much different than zero and their confidence intervals all include zero. Although, Central and Alaskan regions both have rather wide confidence intervals.
